# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This is an end-to-end machine learning system to predict customers with a high potential to leave the telecommunication provider and retain them before they actually leave.

The system is in the 'Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb' file and the data used is telco-churn.csv (from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data).
